## Planning

I wanted the project gallery to tie in with the main website but be a seperate page. I started by using the same colour palette and navbar as the application website and created a figma design that used alot of the strong red as the website, as shown below:

### Original Figma Design:

### Reworked Design (not on Figma):
After the site was built I decided I wanted to move away from the same style as the main website as I felt like it was an oppportunity to play with different colours, I played with code and made a new design:
